        <i>My Travel Blog</i>
    </h5>
    <div>
        <p>Ten years ago, if you told me that I would be a travel blogger at this point in my life, I would have called you crazy!! And here I am.

            What started out as a little travel blog to keep friends and family up-to-date on our around the world trip has grown into something much bigger. This unexpected journey has been a life changing experience, not only for me, but also for Tim, Tyler, and Kara.
            
            If you have dreams of starting your own travel blog, or you just want to learn more about our story, fix yourself a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine 😊), sit back, and enjoy.</p>
